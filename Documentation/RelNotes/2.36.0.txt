Git 2.36 Release Notes
======================

Updates since Git 2.35
----------------------

Backward compatibility warts

 *


Note to those who build from the source

 *


UI, Workflows & Features

 * Assorted updates to "git cat-file", especially "-h".


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git apply" (ab)used the util pointer of the string-list to keep
   track of how each symbolic link needs to be handled, which has been
   simplified by using strset.

 * Fix a hand-rolled alloca() imitation that may have violated
   alignment requirement of data being sorted in compatibility
   implementation of qsort_s() and stable qsort().

 * Use the parse-options API in "git reflog" command.


Fixes since v2.35
-----------------

 * "rebase" and "stash" in secondary worktrees are broken in
   Git 2.35.0, which has been corrected.

 * "git pull --rebase" ignored the rebase.autostash configuration
   variable when the remote history is a descendant of our history,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 3013d98d7a pb/pull-rebase-autostash-fix later to maint).

 * "git update-index --refresh" has been taught to deal better with
   racy timestamps (just like "git status" already does).
   (merge 2ede073fd2 ms/update-index-racy later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge cfc5cf428b jc/find-header later to maint).
   (merge 40e7cfdd46 jh/p4-fix-use-of-process-error-exception later to maint).
   (merge 727e6ea350 jh/p4-spawning-external-commands-cleanup later to maint).
   (merge 0a6adc26e2 rs/grep-expr-cleanup later to maint).
